# Using-Sentence-Transformers-to-Perform-Semantic-Search-

I am showing here how Sentence Transformers can be used to perform semantic search. I have created a small corpus with example sentences of descriptions of top 20 startups in Canada taken from https://www.foundersbeta.com/tech-companies/20-tech-companies-to-watch-for-in-2021/  website to demonstrate how this could work.
I search for 3 queries (included in the notebook) and found the similarity using two methods (cosine similarity using the semantic search in sentence transformers and FAISS by Facebook).
